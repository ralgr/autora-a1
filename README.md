## Description

An interactive map that informs a user of various sightseeing locations depending on their interest.
The application provides a search functionality for the user to search for what they would like.
This search functionality accepts two inputs, Group Context and Stop Type, with the minimum required
for a search being the Stop Type. Upon search, a list of results and their accompanying map markers will appear to give a visual representation of where they are located. Clicking either the result list or the map marker will bring up more detailed information of the location.
