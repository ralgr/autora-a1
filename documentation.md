# Background

What problem are you trying to solve? What is the gravity of the problem? What is your solution to this problem?

I wanted an interactive map that is so simple, anyone can use it. The reason for this is that, most of the older 
generation has difficulty in using map applications and would require assistance. It would also be a good starting 
point for young people to start learning about map applications if they are so incilned. I wanted it to be like google 
maps where one can easily view the important bits of information provided by a database, but stripped of most features, 
and purely for that reason alone. I wanted for users to look at the information of a place, and if they find it interesting, 
have them easily save the location for future use. Its important that the UI is stripped to the bare minimum and not 
make it overly complex for the sake of the older generation and to those that are technologically challenged to, in a sense, 
be more inclusive.

# Methods

What workflows did you use? What build processes did you use? What tools did you use to ensure things like browser support and
support for different devices? What tech stack did you use? What deployment methods did you use

My workflow is based on the waterfall method where every step of the waterfall is a feature. I complete a feature then move on 
to the next and so forth. The difference is, that my workflow repeats for however may times it takes to achieve a satisfactory 
outcome. In that sense, it would be more like a fountain. The first iteration would be to lay the groundwork for each feature I 
plan to implement, making changes along the way until the foundation is completely sturdy. This could be called the groundwork 
iteration, as I am laying down a sturdy foundation that, has all the necessary functions I envisioned but 
aesthetically would look far from ideal but embodies what it will become.The next iteration would then be to flesh out each of 
the features until it reaches a presentable degree but not necessarily the ideal. This is where a feature is given an outward 
appearance that attempts to reach the ideal and also to iron out the internal codes for presentability and ease of use for a 
third-party. Once thats done, the subsequent iterations will be to add to the app until it reaches the said ideal, and is ready 
for deployment.

The project made use of GitHub for version control, Vue.js for creating the app, and Bootstrap CSS framework for its appearance.
As per the Vue.js website, Vue does not support IE8 and lower because of its use of ECMAScript 5 features that are un-shimmable
in IE8 and below. otherwise, it supports every ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers. 

# Implementation

You will explore:

    Deployment to GitHubPages/Firebase
    Real Time Databases (e.g. Firebase), and how data is structured
    Design patterns

should be considered
Mapping and geolocation, what concepts did you use?
Progressive web applications (Advanced)
Unit Testing (Advanced)
